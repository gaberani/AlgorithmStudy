# Given a matrix consists of 0 and 1, find the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.
# The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.

# The number of elements of the given matrix will not exceed 10,000.
# There are at least one 0 in the given matrix.
# The cells are adjacent in only four directions: up, down, left and right.
